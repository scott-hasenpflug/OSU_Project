### Most common jobs

What are the most common job titles? (There are 1,728 unique job titles at OSU.
We'll look at the top 12).

```{r , echo=FALSE}
osu %>% 
  count(job.title, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  head(12) %>% 
  mutate(job.title = fct_reorder(job.title, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(job.title, n, fill = beaver.Orange)) +
  geom_col() + 
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "Total # of Employees") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
