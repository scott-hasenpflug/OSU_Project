My Qs:
What to do with 4 scripts?
FUNCTIONS

Requests:
Head count
Full Time Equivalent
Tenure v salary
More granular salary and tenure bins
Salary of professor v other instructor by employment length
Is the % of tenured faculty consistent across units?
Pay rates for different types of faculty
Do classified pay rates correlate with tenure
Overlap in compensation rates across classified and unclassified
Compare IT compensation specifically

I would challenge whether these are really Director positions, might be title
inflation.The rows that show a range over 100% would be interesting to drill
down and see the actual titles of the positions.

Can you do a distribution of salaries (by bin) of Director titles vs. Manager
titles? I would like to see where there is overlap at the top of the manager range
and the bottom of the Director range.

Also would be interesting to know the percentage of titles that are Manager,
Director, Executive Director, AVP/VP.
