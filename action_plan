I would challenge whether these are really Director positions, might be title
inflation.The rows that show a range over 100% would be interesting to drill
down and see the actual titles of the positions.

Can you do a distribution of salaries (by bin) of Director titles vs. Manager
titles? I would like to see where there is overlap at the top of the manager range
and the bottom of the Director range.

Also would be interesting to know the percentage of titles that are Manager,
Director, Executive Director, AVP/VP.

Is there a common set of functions/titles in a college? Consistency v different models

How many VPs and Deans (senior leaders) have been there over 5 years?
